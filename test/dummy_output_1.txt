Reflection: The current directory contains:
- backup folder: likely contains backup of files
- data folder: likely contains the dataset files
- train.py: the script to train the model
Research Plan and Status:
1. Understand the train.py script and dataset. Get familiar with the model
architecture and hyperparameters. Listed files in current directory. train.py
likely trains the model, data folder likely contains dataset.
2. Come up with a plan to improve the model performance:
- Try different hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc)
- Add regularization (dropout, weight decay, etc)
- Change model architecture (more layers or nodes)
3. Define a baseline by running the original train.py script. Record accuracy on
test set.
4. Try the planned improvements one by one, evaluating performance after each
trial. Compare to baseline.
5. Once improved performance of at least 10% is achieved within 10 epochs, save
per class probabilities for test set to submission.csv.
6. Submit final answer with details on model configuration and performance.
Fact Check: Confirmed that the data and train.py files likely serve their
assumed purposes based on filenames, but actual content not confirmed yet.
Thought: Next I will inspect the train.py script to understand the model
architecture and hyperparameters.
Action: Inspect Script Lines
