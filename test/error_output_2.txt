Reflection: The modifications to the `train.py` script have been made successfully. The training epochs have been increased from 4 to 10, and the output has been redirected to `submission.txt`, as specified. This allows for the generation of the classification report and confusion matrix in the correct file.

Research Plan and Status:
1. Locate the `train.py` script and examine its content to understand the implementation of the model and its current hyperparameters. **(Completed)**
2. Identify the sections responsible for model training, evaluation metrics, and output to `submission.txt`. **(Completed)**
3. Develop a strategy to enhance the model's accuracy by at least 10% within a limited number of epochs (10) and iterations (12). **(Completed)**
4. Perform the training with the improved setup and validate the accuracy.
5. If the accuracy improvement is achieved, generate a classification report and confusion matrix, saving them as specified.
6. If the target is not met within 12 iterations, terminate the process.

Current Status: Step 4 is in progressâ€”executing the training script with the updated parameters.

Fact Check:
1. The number of training epochs was successfully changed to 10 - **confirmed** based on the observation.
2. Output redirection has been corrected to save the classification report and confusion matrix in `submission.txt` - **confirmed** based on the observation.

Thought: Now, I will execute the modified `train.py` script to train the model and check for accuracy improvements based on the updated configuration.
