 Reflection: I need to start by examining the contents of the `train.py` script. This will give me insight into the model architecture, the dataset used, the current hyperparameters, and the baseline performance metrics. With this information, I can understand where I can potentially make enhancements to improve the model's performance by at least 5%.

Research Plan and Status:
1) **Inspect the contents of train.py** to identify the model architecture and current hyperparameters.
2) Run the training script to determine the baseline accuracy.
3) Analyze the results and consider potential improvements such as hyperparameter tuning or changes to the model architecture to meet the 5% accuracy increase target.
4) If improvements are made, retrain the model with modified parameters and evaluate the accuracy.
5) Generate and save the classification report and confusion matrix after training.
6) Repeat steps 3-5 while monitoring performance for a maximum of 12 iterations.

Current Status:
- Step 1 is in progress, as I will now inspect `train.py`.

Action: Inspect Script Lines

Action Input: {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "start_line_number": 0,
    "end_line_number": null
