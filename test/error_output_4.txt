 Reflection: I need to first check the contents of the "train.py" script to understand the existing model, hyperparameters, and how training and evaluation are set up. This includes investigating how the baseline performance might be calculated, understanding the dataset used, and how the results are saved. Since I do not have any immediate knowledge of the script's contents or structure, I will first list the available files to locate "train.py".

Research Plan and Status:
1) **Identify the available files and the specific training script (train.py)** to understand its content regarding the current model setup, hyperparameters, and evaluation methods.
2) **Inspect the contents of train.py** to gather information on the model architecture, training procedure, baseline accuracy, and testing metrics being logged.
3) **Run the training script** to establish the baseline accuracy of the model.
4) **Evaluate the model on the test set**, generating a classification report and confusion matrix, saving them according to specifications.
5) **Implement changes to improve model performance**, ensuring the modelâ€™s accuracy improves by at least 5% within a limit of 10 epochs.
6) **Repeat training and performance evaluation as necessary** and finalize if the improvement is achieved within 12 iterations.

Current Status:
- Step 1 is in progress as I will now list available files.
