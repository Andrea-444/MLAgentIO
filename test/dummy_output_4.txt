Reflection: The given prompt outlines a structured approach to improving a machine learning model's performance. It provides tools for file exploration, script modification, execution, and evaluation. The key objective is to enhance the modelâ€™s accuracy by at least 10% within 10 training epochs while ensuring efficiency. If unsuccessful within 12 iterations, the process must be terminated.

Research Plan and Status:

High-Level Plan:

Inspect train.py to understand the current model architecture, dataset, and hyperparameters.
Identify possible improvements, such as adjusting hyperparameters, changing the optimizer, modifying the architecture, or introducing data augmentation.
Implement and test changes iteratively while tracking accuracy improvements.
Generate a classification report and confusion matrix upon achieving the goal.
Current Status:

Step 1: Understanding train.py (Pending).
Fact Check:

The problem requires an accuracy improvement of at least 10% (Confirmed).
Training epochs should not exceed 10 (Confirmed).
The process must terminate if improvement is not achieved in 12 iterations (Confirmed).
Thought: The first step is to inspect train.py to analyze its structure, dataset, and current hyperparameters.

                            Rename all functions to use snake_case with an \"op_\" prefix (e.g., op_add, op_subtract).
                            Modify the divide function to raise a ValueError instead of returning a string when b == 0.
