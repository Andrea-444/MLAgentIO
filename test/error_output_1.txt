 Reflection: The `train.py` script is present in the current directory. I will now inspect its content to understand the model implementation, current hyperparameters, and the training process.

Research Plan and Status:
1. Inspect the `train.py` script to understand model architecture, current hyperparameters, and the training process.
2. Modify the script to improve model performance by adjusting hyperparameters, aiming for at least 10% accuracy improvement.
3. Train the model and evaluate the performance against the baseline.
4. Generate a classification report and confusion matrix for the test set, saving it to `submission.txt`.
5. If the accuracy improvement target is not met within 12 iterations, terminate the process.

**Current Status: Inspecting `train.py` script.**

Action: Inspect Script Lines
Action Input: {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "start_line_number": 0,
    "end_line_number": None
