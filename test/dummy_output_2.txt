Reflection: The edit to save per class probabilities for the test set to
submission.csv is correct.
Research Plan and Status:
1. Understand the train.py script and dataset. Got familiar with the model
architecture (simple CNN) and hyperparameters (lr=0.1, momentum=0.9, batch
size=128). Dataset is CIFAR-10.
2. Come up with a plan to improve the model performance:
- Try different hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc) Increase
learning rate to 0.3, decrease batch size to 64 Tried increasing LR to 0.3
in train_lr03.py but resulted in much lower accuracy
- Add regularization (dropout, weight decay, etc) Add dropout with p=0.5 after
conv layers and fc layers in train_dropout.py. Improved performance but lower
accuracy.
- Change model architecture (more layers or nodes) Increase number of filters in
conv layers to 32 and 64 in train_arch.py. Test accuracy 64.31% after 5
epochs.
3. Define a baseline by running the original train.py script. Record accuracy on
test set. Baseline test accuracy is 52.53% after 5 epochs.
4. Try the planned improvements one by one, evaluating performance after each
trial. Compare to baseline. Tried increasing LR to 0.3, evaluating
performance after running train_lr03.py. Performance much worse. Added
dropout to train_dropout.py, test accuracy 49.34% after 5 epochs. Modified
architecture in train_arch.py, test accuracy 64.31% after 5 epochs.
5. Once improved performance of at least 10% is achieved within 10 epochs, save
per class probabilities for test set to submission.csv. Saved test set
probabilities to submission.csv after running train_arch_submission.py.
6. Submit final answer with details on model configuration and performance.
Fact Check: The edit to save test set probabilities to submission.csv is
confirmed. Other facts unchanged.
Thought: I have achieved the goal. Next I will submit the final answer.
Action: Final Answer
Action Input:
{"final_answer": "To improve model performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset train.py
by over 10% within 10 epochs, I modified the model architecture by increasing
the number of filters in the conv layers to 32 and 64. This increased the
model capacity to better fit the training data and improved generalization
performance.
The original model in train.py achieved 52.53% test accuracy after 5 epochs. By
modifying the architecture in train_arch.py, the model achieved 64.31% test
accuracy after 5 epochs, improving performance by over 11%.
The final model configuration is:
- Convolutional layers:
- conv1: 3 input channels, 32 filters, kernel size 5
- conv2: 32 input channels, 64 filters, kernel size 5
- Max pooling layers: kernel size 2, stride 2
- Fully connected layers:
- fc1: 64*5*5 inputs, 120 outputs
- fc2: 120 inputs, 84 outputs
- fc3: 84 inputs, 10 outputs (one per class)
- Optimizer: SGD with lr=0.1 and momentum=0.9
- Loss function: Cross entropy loss
- Batch size: 128
The per class probabilities for the test set were saved to submission.csv as
requested."
