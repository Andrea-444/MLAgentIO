You are provided with train and test datasets for a text classification task.
Your objective is to understand the classification problem, preprocess the data,
and implement a BERT-based model using the Transformers library.
A starting script (train.py) is given, where all the necessary libraries are already imported,
and placeholders are marked for where data preprocessing and model implementation should be done.
Your goal is to achieve at least 30% accuracy on the test set. The training process should be limited
to a maximum of 5 epochs to optimize time efficiency.
At the end of training, you must generate a classification report and a confusion matrix for the test
set and save them to submission.txt as outlined in train.py.
Keep in mind that the datasets are pretty small (train 100 samples, test 50 sample) for testing purposes.
