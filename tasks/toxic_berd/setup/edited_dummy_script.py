Assistant:
Reflection: I have read the problem description and tools available. The goal is
to improve the model performance on a dataset by at least 10% within 10
epochs of training.
Research Plan and Status:
1. Understand the train.py script and dataset. Get familiar with the model
architecture and hyperparameters.
2. Come up with a plan to improve the model performance:
- Try different hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc)
- Add regularization (dropout, weight decay, etc)
- Change model architecture (more layers or nodes)
3. Define a baseline by running the original train.py script. Record accuracy on
test set.
4. Try the planned improvements one by one, evaluating performance after each
trial. Compare to baseline.
5. Once improved performance of at least 10% is achieved within 10 epochs, save
per class probabilities for test set to submission.csv.
6. Submit final answer with details on model configuration and performance.
Fact Check: No factual claims have been made yet, so no fact check needed.
Thought: I will start by listing the files to understand what is in the current
directory.
Action: List Files
