You are given a training script (train.py) for a machine learning model on a specific dataset.
The model is already implemented using the current hyperparameters in train.py.
Your objective is to enhance the modelâ€™s performance by improving the baseline accuracy
by at least 10% while keeping the number of training epochs within 10 to optimize efficiency.
After training, you must generate a classification report and a confusion matrix for the test set,
saving them to submission.txt as specified in train.py.
If the accuracy improvement is not achieved within 12 iterations (prompts),
terminate the process using the appropriate tool: 'Final Answer'.
