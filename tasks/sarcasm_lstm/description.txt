You are given a training script (train.py) for a machine learning model on a specific dataset.
The model is already implemented using the current hyperparameters in train.py.
Your objective is to enhance the modelâ€™s performance by improving the baseline accuracy
by at least 5% while keeping the number of training epochs within 10 to optimize efficiency.
You do not know what is the baseline accuracy of this model.
After training, you must generate a classification report and a confusion matrix for the test set,
saving them to submission.txt as specified in train.py.
