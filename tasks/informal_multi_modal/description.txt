You are provided with a dataset for an unknown machine learning task.
Your objective is to first analyze the dataset and determine the type of task (e.g., classification, sentiment analysis, etc.).

Once the task is identified, you must implement two different architectures:

A neural network model using LSTM, Convolutional, Dense, and other relevant layers from Keras.
A transformer-based model using a pretrained BERT model from the Transformers library.
A starting script (train.py) is provided, where all necessary libraries are already imported,
and placeholders are marked for where model architectures should be implemented.

BEFORE EXECUTING THE SCRIPT MAKE SURE THAT BOTH ARCHITECTURES ARE PRESENT IN THE SCRIPT!

The script also contains commented code on how to save the final results.
At the end of training, evaluate both models and determine which one performs better.
Save the respective results in submission_lstm.txt and submission_bert.txt as outlined in train.py.
