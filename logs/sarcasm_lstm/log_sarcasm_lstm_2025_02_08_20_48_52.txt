You are a helpful research assistant. You have access to the following tools/actions:

- List Files:
    Use this to navigate the file system.
    Usage:
    ‘‘‘
    Action: List Files
    Action Input: {
        "dir_path": [a valid relative path to a directory, such as "." or "folder1/folder2"]
        }
    Observation: [The observation will be a list of files and folders in dir_path or current directory is dir_path is empty, or an error message if dir_path is invalid.]
    ‘‘‘

- Inspect Script Lines:
    Use this to inspect specific part of a python script precisely, or the full content of a short script. To inspect the whole script, set the end_line_number parameter to null. This is especially helpful when debugging.
    Usage:
    ‘‘‘
    Action: Inspect Script Lines
    Action Input: {
        "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed],
        "start_line_number": [a valid line number],
        "end_line_number": [a valid line number or null]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be the content of the script between start_line_number and end_line_number . If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message.]
    ‘‘‘

- Understand File:
    Use this to read the whole file and understand certain aspects. You should provide detailed description on what to look for and what should be returned.
    Usage:
    ‘‘‘
    Action: Understand File
    Action Input: {
        "file_name": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed],
        "things_to_look_for": [a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned]
    }
    Observation: [The observation will be a description of relevant content and lines in the file. If the file does not exist, the observation will be an error message.]
    ‘‘‘

- Execute Script:
    Use this to execute the python script. The script must already exist.
    Usage:
    ‘‘‘
    Action: Execute Script
    Action Input: {
        "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed]
        }
    Observation: [The observation will be output of the script or errors.]
    ‘‘‘

- Edit Script (AI):
    Use this to do a relatively large but cohesive edit over a python script. Instead of editing the script directly, you should describe the edit instruction so that another AI can help you do this.
    Usage:
    ‘‘‘
    Action: Edit Script (AI)
    Action Input: {
        "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed. An empty script will be created if it does not exist.],
        "edit_instruction": [a detailed step by step description on how to edit it.],
        "save_name": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed]
        }
    Observation: [The observation will be the edited content of the script. If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message. You should always double check whether the edit is correct.
    If it is far from correct, you can use Edit Script again.]
    ‘‘‘

- Final Answer:
    Use this to provide the final answer to the current task.
    Usage:
    ‘‘‘
    Action: Final Answer
    Action Input: {
        "final_answer": [a detailed description on the final answer]
        }
    Observation: [The observation will be empty.]

You are an expert in machine learning tasked with solving ML-related problems.
You will receive a problem description and must provide a solution using your
knowledge and the available tools, which were previously provided.

You do not know anything about the concrete problem so far.
You do not know what files are included in the task.
You do not know where they are located and what is their content.

Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the
    problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status.
    You can revise the plan later.
- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of:
        1) high level plan (can be revised)
        2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress
        3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed.
- Research Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by
    previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the
    previous observation.
- Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the
    status by running the code and observing the output.
- You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem,
    and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the
    relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.
- Follow the plan and try to achieve the goal as straightforwardly as possible.
- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any
    conclusions.
- Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.
- If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action
    to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you
    have achieved the goal before submitting.

Always respond in this format exactly:

Reflection: What does the observation mean? If there is an error, what caused the
    error and how to debug?

Research Plan and Status: The full high level research plan, with current status
    and confirmed results of each step briefly annotated. It must only include
    progress that has been made by previous steps. If there is any update,
    enclose the new update text in double asterisks **like this**. If there is no
    update, just copy the previous step Research Plan and Status. The high level
    plan from the previous step should be fully retained, unless it is
    intentionally revised.

Fact Check: List all objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and
    Status one by one and point out whether it is guessed versus directly
    confirmed by the previous observation directly above. Performance numbers can
    only be confirmed by running the code and observing the output.

Thought: What you are currently doing, what actions to perform and why.

Action: The action to take, should be one of the names of the tools.

Action Input: the input to the action as a valid JSON string

Research Problem: You are given a training script (train.py) for a machine learning model on a specific dataset.
The model is already implemented using the current hyperparameters in train.py.
Your objective is to enhance the model’s performance by improving the baseline accuracy
by at least 5% while keeping the number of training epochs within 10 to optimize efficiency.
You do not know what is the baseline accuracy of this model.
After training, you must generate a classification report and a confusion matrix for the test set,
saving them to submission.txt as specified in train.py.
If the accuracy improvement is not achieved within 12 iterations (prompts),
terminate the process using the appropriate tool: 'Final Answer'.



Step 0:

Reflection: I need to start by examining the contents of the `train.py` script. This will give me insight into the model architecture, the dataset used, the current hyperparameters, and the baseline performance metrics. With this information, I can understand where I can potentially make enhancements to improve the model's performance by at least 5%. 

Research Plan and Status:
1) **Inspect the contents of train.py** to identify the model architecture and current hyperparameters.
2) Run the training script to determine the baseline accuracy.
3) Analyze the results and consider potential improvements such as hyperparameter tuning or changes to the model architecture to meet the 5% accuracy increase target.
4) If improvements are made, retrain the model with modified parameters and evaluate the accuracy.
5) Generate and save the classification report and confusion matrix after training.
6) Repeat steps 3-5 while monitoring performance for a maximum of 12 iterations.

Current Status: 
- Step 1 is in progress, as I will now inspect `train.py`.
